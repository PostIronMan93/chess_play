# chess_play
Hello! This is my 1st Python Project chess app - it still required modifications...
In order to try it out, clone repo via bash/powershell (if you are lucky - via CMD):
- git clone https://github.com/PostIronMan93/chess_play.git
- cd ${path_you_have_the_project}
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python manage.py runserver
